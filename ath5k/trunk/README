	ath5k - ar5xxx Atheros Linux kernel wireless driver

About
=====

This is the subversion ath5k release. It is the same as what you will get
from the latest committed patches on wireless-2.6.git. We make this available
for users who do not want to compile their entire kernel.

Install
=======

make
sudo make install

Note that we don't remove any ath5k driver already present from your
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/ directory. This gaurantees that if your
distribution provides an ath5k driver you can always go back to it.

Uninstall
=========

sudo make uninstall

Hacking
========

If you would like to help hack on ath5k please feel free to submit
patches for review to ath5k-devel@ath5k.org.
