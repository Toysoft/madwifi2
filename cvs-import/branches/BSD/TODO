HIGH PRIO:

- manually scanning is not available before background scan, which is initiated
  after setting interface up, is done through finding an accesspoint
    - what does that mean?
- check locking (especially the macros in ieee80211_linux.h)
    - too strict locking -> loose performance
    - too soft -> oops
- send multicast / broadcast frames with highest possible basic rate
    -  allow user configuration of basic rates
- IBSS merging, sychronization and beaconing
- implement "right" iwconfig ath0 key open / restricted behaviour
    - authentication mode open / shared key
- merge in changes from FreeBSD since last merge from 12.04.2005
- AIFS and CWMIN are set wrong on the beacon queue.  They should be zero 
  for AP mode but CWMIN should be 2x for adhoc mode (check the spec).
- check if private crypto tkip implementation works for cards without hardware 
  crypto support (SWMIC, SWCRYPT).

LOW PRIO:

- define commonly used macros global
- cleanup code
- remove redundand definitions which have been copied from FreeBSD
    - e.g.: struct ether_header

LONG TERM:

- integration with linux ieee 802.11 stack (work in progress)
- inclusion into linux kernel

IDEAS:

- generate a Configure script to create a Makefile fitting the build environment
- write a userspace tool to control all the things wireless_tools do but
  furthermore also things which are not supported by them
    - e.g.: wme + parameters, beacon interval, ack/cts timeouts...
