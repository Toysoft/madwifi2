- wpa_supplicant (using madwifi) doesn't reconnect if the hostapd goes down and
  up again, beeing stuck waiting for the scan finished wireless event
- check locking (especially the macros in ieee80211_linux.h)
    - to strict locking -> loose performance
    - to soft -> oops
- define commonly used macros global
- cleanup code
- generate a Configure script to create a Makefile fitting the build environment
- write a userspace tool to control all the things wireless_tools do but
  furthermore also things which are not supported by them
    - e.g.: wme + parameters, beacon interval, ack/cts timeouts...
