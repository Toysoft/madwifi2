- check locking (especially the macros in ieee80211_linux.h)
    - to strict locking -> loose performance
    - to soft -> oops
- ath_pci module unloading issue on linux 2.6.x kernels (dev->refcnt)
    - seems to only occur in managed mode ?
- define commonly used macros global
- cleanup code
- generate a Configure script to create a Makefile fitting the build environment
- write a userspace tool to control all the things wireless_tools do but
  furthermore also things which are not supported by them
    - e.g.: wme + parameters, beacon interval, ack/cts timeouts...
