This directory contains the bit needed to integrate the madwifi
source distribution into a Linux kernel source tree.  To do this
unpack the kernel distribution and run the install.sh script.  If you
want to patch the currently running system you can do

sh install.sh

otherwise you can specify the source tree location on the command line:

sh install.sh /usr/src/linux

The following directories will be created and populated:

net/net80211
drivers/net/wireless/ath
drivers/net/wireless/ath_hal
drivers/net/wireless/hal

The appropriate kernel build files will be patched so that you can
run "make menuconfig" or similar and configure the driver using the
normal mechanisms.

Note that this has been done only for the 2.6.0 kernel.  You may need
to generate some additional patch files for your kernel sources to
automate this procedure.  Use the supplied files for guidance.
