Atheros Driver For Linux
=========================

* Copyright (c) 2002, 2003 Sam Leffler.  All rights reserved.

Read the file COPYRIGHT; this is not GPL code.

This software contains a kernel driver for Atheros-based Wireless LAN
devices.  The driver supports both station and AP modes of operation.
The driver is actually a port of the BSD Atheros driver and includes
a port of the 802.11 link layer code originally found in NetBSD.
You may/will also find other BSD-ish glue code.  As much as possible
I've tried to make this driver a "native Linux" driver that conforms to
Linux style and operation but in some areas of operation you may still
see elements of BSD design/operation.

The driver functions as a normal network device and uses the Wireless
Extensions API.  As such normal Linux tools can and should be used
with it.

There are two drivers included here:

ath_pci for PCI devices, and
ath_cs for Cardbus devices

These drivers are built as modules that are loaded with insmod or
modprobe.  Both drivers depend on a wlan module that includes the 802.11
state protocol support and other glue code.

The Atheros drivers depends on a chunk of code termed the Hardware
Access Layer (HAL).  This code manages much of the hardware-specific
operation of the driver.  The HAL is provided in a binary-only form in
order to comply with FCC regulations.  If you wish to use this driver
on a platform that is not already supported please contact the author
to arrange compilation of the HAL.  Note that this is only necessary for
new _architectures_; the HAL is not tied to any specific version of Linux.


Building the driver
===================
To build the driver at the top level edit Makefile.inc and set the
pathname to your Linux kernel distribution.  By default this is set to
/usr/src/linux.

Then do:

make depend
make

This will generate two files:

driver/ath_pci.o (for PCI devices), and
driver/ath_cs.o (for Cardbus devices)

These files can be loaded with insmod or modprobe.  You can also use:

make install

to install the drivers where they can be loaded automatically at boot.

[So far this has only been tested with RH 7.3 and a 2.4.20 kernel on an
 x86 machine.]

Feedback
========
Please send all correspondence about this driver to:

I will try to respond in a timely manner but understand this software
is provided as-is; with no support.
