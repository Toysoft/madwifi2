Atheros Driver For Linux
=========================

* Copyright (c) 2002, 2003 Sam Leffler.  All rights reserved.

Read the file COPYRIGHT; this is not GPL code.

This software contains a kernel driver for Atheros-based Wireless LAN
devices.  The driver supports both station and AP modes of operation.
The driver is actually a port of the BSD Atheros driver and includes
a port of the 802.11 link layer code originally found in NetBSD.
You may/will also find other BSD-ish glue code.  As much as possible
I've tried to make this driver a "native Linux" driver that conforms to
Linux style and operation but in some areas of operation you will see
elements of BSD design/operation.

The driver functions as a normal network device and uses the Wireless
Extensions API.  As such normal Linux tools can and should be used
with it.

There is only one driver included here; it supports miniPCI and Cardbus
devices.  The driver can be built as a module or linked into the kernel.

The driver depends on a wlan module that contains the 802.11 state machine,
protocol support, and other glue code.  This code is derived from work
that first appeared in NetBSD and then FreeBSD.

The Atheros drivers depends on a chunk of code termed the Hardware
Access Layer (HAL).  This code manages much of the hardware-specific
operation of the driver.  The HAL is provided in a binary-only form in
order to comply with FCC regulations.  If you wish to use this driver
on a platform that is not already supported please contact the author.
Note that this is only necessary for new _architectures_; the HAL is
not tied to any specific version of Linux.


Building the driver
===================
To build the driver at the top level edit Makefile.inc and set the
pathname to your Linux kernel distribution.  By default this is set to
/usr/src/linux.

Then do:

	make

This will generate two important files:

driver/ath_pci.o (driver for PCI/Cardbus devices), and
wlan/wlan.o (802.11 support layer)

These files can be loaded with insmod or modprobe; e.g.

	insmod wlan/wlan.o
	insmod driver/ath_pci.o

(note you must load the wlan module first as the driver depends on it).
You can also use:

	make install

to install the drivers where they can be loaded automatically at boot.

[So far this has only been tested with RH 7.3 and 2.4.18, and 2.4.20
 kernels on an x86 machine.]

Feedback
========
Please send all correspondence about this driver to:

I will try to respond in a timely manner but understand this software
is provided as-is; with no support.
