mcgrof notes:

* Almost done with new regdomains, now we just need to add a mac80211 call which
  gives an array using the default cfg80211 regdomain.

Up to reviewing ath_reset()

--

We want a driver in the kernel, we'll be fine with just Managed mode
support so lets shoot for that, remove anything else for now. Lets start
the driver from the ground up. 

TODO:

* New mac80211 port
* Remove most typdefs
* Remove HAL interface, access hardware directly (in progress)
* Just get Managed mode support working, remove everything else
* Clean up and get into the kernel

* Add get/set capabilities: RFKILL, 

----

Cleanup:

* Remove overuse of typedefs
* Remove unused or unimplemented routines:

--
Unused HAL routines:

OpenHAL				Old driver call
ath5k_hw_wait_for_beacon()	ath_hal_waitforbeacon()

--
Uimplemented HAL routines:

OpenHAL				Old driver call
ath5k_hw_set_capability()	ah_setCapability()
ath5k_hw_proc_mib_event()	ah_procMibEvent()
ath5k_hw_get_tx_inter_queue()	ah_getTxIntrQueue()
--


Done

Macro to remove function pointer using::
Old driver			Function-pointer	New macro
ath_hal_setuptxdesc()		ah_setup_tx_desc()	ath5k_hw_tx_desc_setup()
ath_hal_setupxtxdesc()		ah_setup_xtx_desc()	ath5k_hw_tx_desc_setup_xr()
ath_hal_filltxdesc()		ah_fill_tx_desc()	ath5k_hw_tx_desc_fill()
ath_hal_txprocdesc()		ah_proc_tx_desc()	ath5k_hw_tx_desc_proc()
ath_hal_rxprocdesc()		ah_proc_rx_desc()	ath5k_hw_rx_desc_proc()
