This is a new driver for atheros wireless cards. It doesn't work yet
but the goal is to get it into the kernel. It is based on madwifi-old-openhal
revision 2572, which received changes last on revision 2539 on date 
2007-07-05 00:54:53 -0400 (Thu, 05 Jul 2007).

Atheros Hardware
================
There are currently 3 "programming generations" of Atheros 802.11
wireless devices (some of these have multiple hardware implementations
but otherwise appear identical to users):

5210	supports 11a only
5211	supports both 11a and 11b
5212	supports 11a, 11b, and 11g

These parts have been incorporated in a variety of retail products
including cardbus cards from DLink, Linksys, Netgear, Orinoco,
Proxim, and 3Com; and mini-pci cards from some of these same vendors.
In addition many laptop vendors use Atheros mini-pci cards for their
builtin wireless support.  For an up-to-date list of cards based
on Atheros parts visit:

In general, if a device is identified as ``11a only'' it is almost
certain to contain an Atheros 5210 part in it.  Most retail a+b
products use the 5211.  Many a+b+g combo products use the 5212
though other vendors have started to offer dual-band support.  When
in doubt check the PCI vendor id with a tool like lspci, the Atheros
vendor id is 0x168c; e.g.

   00:13.0 Ethernet controller: Unknown device 168c:0012 (rev 01)

but beware that come vendors use alternate vendor id's (e.g 3Com, IBM).
The file hal/ah_devid.h has a list of known PCI id's.
