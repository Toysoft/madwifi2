	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an Atheros 5xxx 
	  series Cardbus or PCI wireless Ethernet networking card to 
	  your computer. This driver uses mac80211 stack.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called ath5k.  If unsure, say M.

config ATH5K_AR5210
	bool "Support AR5210"

	default y

config ATH5K_AR5211
	bool "Support AR5211"

	default y

config ATH5K_AR5212
	bool "Support AR5212"
